## Since `app` is defined in scope, we need to use it to create a `TestClient` object for testing.
## If the `app` object is not instantiated at the global level, ensure that the following line
## is inside a fixture that returns a TestClient with the `app` instance.
#client = TestClient(app)
#

#    """
#    Test to ensure that the `root` endpoint responds with a 200 status code and does not raise any errors.

#    response = client.get("/")
#    assert response.status_code == 200
