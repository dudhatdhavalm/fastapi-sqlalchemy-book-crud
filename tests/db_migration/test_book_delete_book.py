#    # Set up a mock book to delete. Presuming a mock book with id = 1 exists.
#    book_id = 1

## Additional tests would include checks for successful deletion, attempting to delete a non-existing book, etc.
## However, since these could alter the database or require an actual database connection, they are not included.
## Ensure that for the remaining tests, the correct database state is assumed and rollback or setup is properly handled.
